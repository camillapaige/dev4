    "# Asana Task and Attachment Export Script\n",
    "This script uses the Asana API to access tasks, subtasks, and attachments. The script retrieves tasks and subtasks from all of the projects that the user has access to, extracts their details, and saves them to a CSV file. It also retrieves attachments for each task. The output of the script is saved to the same location as the script itself. The script creates a folder \"attachments\". Each project has a folder inside \"attachments,\" and each task has a folder inside the project folder which contains the associated attachments. The script also creates a log file of any projects that were skipped. For the use case of the GRID3 team, all of the projects that the user has access to will be downloaded. Due to the large file size, projects will be processed in batches of 25. The script zips all of the output into one zip file. "
